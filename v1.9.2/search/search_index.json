We recommend customers deploy AWS Control Tower as the foundational landing zone and enhance their landing zone capabilities with Landing Zone Accelerator. These complementary capabilities provides a comprehensive low-code solution across 35+ AWS services to manage and govern a multi-account environment built to support customers with highly-regulated workloads and complex compliance requirements. AWS Control Tower and Landing Zone Accelerator help you establish platform readiness with security, compliance, and operational capabilities.</p> <p>Landing Zone Accelerator is provided as an open-source project that is built using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK). You install directly into your environment to get full access to the infrastructure as code (IaC) solution. Through a simplified set of configuration files, you are able to configure additional functionality, controls and security services (eg. AWS Managed Config Rules, and AWS Security Hub), manage your foundational networking topology (eg. VPCs, Transit Gateways, and Network Firewall), and generate additional workload accounts using the AWS Control Tower Account Factory.</p> <p>There are no additional charges or upfront commitments required to use Landing Zone Accelerator on AWS. You pay only for AWS services enabled in order to set up your platform and operate your controls. This solution can also support non-standard AWS partitions, including AWS GovCloud (US), and the US Secret and Top Secret regions.</p> <p>For an overview and solution deployment guide, please visit Landing Zone Accelerator on AWS</p> <p>Important</p> <p>This solution will not, by itself, make you compliant.

AWS Control Tower and Landing Zone Accelerator help you establish platform readiness with security, compliance, and operational capabilities.</p> <p>The configuration of LZA is managed through configuration files. Configuration files are written in YAML and define the AWS account and service configurations that meet specific compliance objectives. Using the configuration files, the solution helps users manage the lifecycle of their landing zone by setting up a baseline security architecture and automating common administrative and operational activities. This reduces the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with building regulated environments on AWS, allowing organizations to focus on other high value concerns such as operating models, developer agility, and reducing costs.</p> <p>After deploying LZA and implementing these configuration files, you can:</p> <ul> <li>Configure additional functionality, guardrails, and security services such as AWS Config Managed Rules and AWS Security Hub</li> <li>Manage your foundational networking topology such as Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), AWS Transit Gateway, and AWS Network Firewall</li> <li>Generate additional workload accounts using the AWS Control Tower Account Factory or AWS Organizations</li> </ul> <p>This guide describes architectural considerations, design, and configuration steps for deploying the LZA sample configuration files.</p> <p>We recommend you familiarize yourself with the best practices for for managing your configuration files before making any chances to your environment.</p> <p>Note: This README is focused on the general sample configuration, not the industry specific configuration files which can be found here.</p>"},{"location":"sample-configurations/standard/overview/#design-principles","title":"Design Principles","text":"<ol> <li>Help customers implement a secure by design multi-account architecture aligned to AWS best practices</li> <li>Maximize agility, scalability, and availability while minimizing cost</li> <li>Enable the full capabilities of the AWS cloud</li> <li>Remove burden from customers by maintaining the deployment engine and configuration files to make use of the latest AWS innovations</li> <li>Offer customers flexibility to add capabilities and reconfigure the environment in an automated manner</li> <li>Reduce scope of impact by implementing logical separation between functions e.g. organizational networking, security, and workloads</li> </ol>"},{"location":"sample-configurations/standard/overview/#architecture-summary","title":"Architecture Summary","text":"<p>The architecture and best practices defined in these configuration files are heavily influenced by the AWS whitepaper Organizing Your AWS Environment Using Multiple Accounts and the AWS Security Reference Architecture.
