# Security Hub Findings

The Landing Zone Accelerator on AWS (LZA) solution includes a feature to enable AWS Security Hub, which provides a comprehensive view of the security state and helps you assess your environment against security standards and best practices. When deploying LZA, it is essential to review and address the Security Hub findings to ensure a secure environment based on your requirements. The following table provides guidance on AWS Security Hub findings that you may encounter during the deployment of LZA using sample configurations.

!!! note
    You should regularly review and monitor new findings in AWS Security Hub, as your environment and workloads evolve over time. This guidance applies to the resources created and managed by the Landing Zone Accelerator on AWS solution. For other findings in your environment, it is recommend to follow the [Security Hub controls reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-controls-reference.html).
